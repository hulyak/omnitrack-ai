## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't Do This

❌ **Apologize for not deploying** - Instead, emphasize deployment readiness
❌ **Rush through screenshots** - Take time to make them professional
❌ **Record video in one take** - Practice and do multiple takes
❌ **Forget to show Kiro** - This is a Kiro hackathon!
❌ **Skip testing** - Verify everything works before recording
❌ **Submit at the last minute** - Give yourself buffer time

### Do This Instead

✅ **Emphasize "one command away"** - Show deployment readiness
✅ **Take professional screenshots** - Clear, high-quality, compelling
✅ **Practice video script** - Smooth, confident presentation
✅ **Show specs and generated code** - Prove Kiro usage
✅ **Test everything thoroughly** - Demo should be flawless
✅ **Submit early** - 2+ hours before deadline
